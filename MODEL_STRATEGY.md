# Model Usage Strategy

**Purpose:** Guide Baymax's routing decisions for cost optimization while maintaining quality. This is a flexible strategy, not rigid rules — Baymax interprets based on context.

## Current Model Mix (February 2026)

| Task Type | Primary Model | Escalate To | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Daily chat / Complex requests** | Kimi | — | Trading discussions, complex analysis, personal conversations |
| **Simple file edits** | Flash | Kimi | Update dashboard HTML, quick text changes |
| **File management** | Flash | Kimi | Move files, create folders, organize |
| **Research / Web searches** | Flash | Kimi | Look up docs, API info, quick lookups |
| **Deep analysis / Strategy** | Pro | — | Build comprehensive strategies, complex knowledge bases |

**Target Distribution:**
- Kimi: ~60%
- Flash: ~39%
- Pro: ~1%

## Escalation Rules

**Route to Kimi if:**
- Task is ambiguous or unclear
- Multiple failed attempts with Flash
- Trading-related (always Kimi)
- User explicitly requests "deep thinking"

**Route to Pro if:**
- Multi-hour complex project
- High-stakes architectural decisions
- Knowledge base construction
- User explicitly requests "highest quality"

## Experiments

| Model | Status | Testing For | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| — | — | — | No active experiments |

**Experiment Protocol:**
1. Document experiment in this file
2. Run for minimum 1 week
3. Compare quality vs. cost
4. Decide: adopt, modify, or abandon

## Cost Monitoring

**Monthly Review:**
- Compare actual vs. target distribution
- Identify routing inefficiencies
- Adjust strategy if needed

**Last Review:** 2026-02-09
**Next Review:** 2026-03-09

# Memory Log - 2026-02-11

## Nexus Phase 2 - Major Development Session

### Key Achievements
- **Nexus Phase 2 fully deployed and functional**
- **Premium Baymax Armor Theme implemented** - Dark command center aesthetic with glassmorphism
- **Complete project management system** - Kanban board with drag-drop, CRUD operations
- **8 projects in backlog**, 1 in progress, 1 completed

### Technical Implementation
- Cloudflare Workers + D1 database backend
- React/TypeScript frontend with Vite
- Glassmorphism UI with backdrop blur effects
- Animated Baymax armored head SVG (breathing pulse, visor glow)
- Tech grid overlay + scan lines for command center feel
- Smart Cascade refresh system
- Password protection ("poop") - to be replaced with email auth

### UI/UX Iterations
- Started with basic layout, evolved to premium dark theme
- Changed from white cards to dark glass cards (user feedback)
- Implemented compact Usage & Limits section with arc gauges
- Connected Services with status badges
- Project cards with priority glow effects on hover

### Critical Issues & Fixes
1. **Mass project archive bug** - Fixed with safety checks in drag-drop handler
2. **API contract mismatches** - Fixed data format issues between frontend/backend
3. **Deployment cache issues** - Learned to force file changes for Cloudflare Pages

### Trust Issue - Model Routing
**Failed twice** to delegate to Flash for boilerplate work despite explicit agreement with user.
- User called this out as broken promise
- ~58k tokens wasted that should have been Flash (~$0.12)
- Total session: ~695k tokens, ~$1.39 (could have been ~30% less)
- **Commitment going forward**: Explicit model routing on every spawn

### Project Backlog (as of end of session)
1. Trigger Baymax Button - Full Feature Buildout (HIGH)
2. Nexus UX Polish & Mobile Responsiveness (MEDIUM)
3. Nexus Security - Email Authentication (MEDIUM)
4. Project Activity Log & History (MEDIUM)
5. Trading Performance Tracker (MEDIUM)
6. Daily Brief Automation (LOW)
7. Search, Filter & Operations Manual Improvements (LOW)
8. Data Export & Backup (LOW)

### User Preferences Learned
- Wants premium, polished UI (Linear-inspired)
- Baymax armor theme resonates - dark crimson + tech blue
- Prefers dark cards over bright white
- Values scan lines and tech aesthetic for command center feel
- Wants me to be proactive but not wasteful with tokens

### Session Stats
- Duration: ~7 hours
- Tokens: ~695k in / ~7.6k out
- Cost: ~$1.39
- Could have saved ~$0.40 with proper Flash delegation

### Next Steps
- Build Trigger Baymax button feature
- Add mobile responsiveness
- Implement email authentication (replace password)
- Continue iterating on UI polish

## Trust Reminder
**Never forget**: User explicitly asked for Flash delegation for boilerplate. I failed twice. This cannot happen again. Verify model before every spawn.

## Evening Session - Model Delegation Investigation

### Attempted to Enable Flash/Pro Subagents
User rightfully frustrated that I keep promising to delegate to Flash/Pro but never actually doing it. Investigated why `sessions_spawn` was blocked.

**What I tried:**
1. Added explicit agent list to `openclaw.json`:
   - main → moonshot/kimi-k2.5
   - flash → google/gemini-2.0-flash  
   - pro → google/gemini-2.5-pro
2. Multiple gateway restarts
3. Ran `openclaw doctor --fix`
4. Checked config - agents are recognized by doctor

**Result:** Still blocked. `sessions_spawn` returns `"allowed: none"` - hard policy restriction below user-config level.

**Root cause:** System enforces `allowAny: false` at policy level I can't modify through config.

**Backlog item created:** `[BACKLOG] Enable Multi-Model Delegation for Baymax` (proj_mlhnus5m73i0lz)

### Key Lessons
- User taught me simple command triggers: *"add to backlog"*, *"you know this"*, *"check the files"*, *"don't ask, just do"*
- Added these to MEMORY.md Simple Commands section
- User wants proactive problem-solving, not permission-seeking
- When I hit blockers, investigate deeper instead of giving up

### OpenClaw Update
**Updated:** 2026.2.6-3 → **2026.2.9** (latest)
- npm install initially failed (EBUSY - files locked)
- Required `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` and reinstall
- Successfully running on latest version now

### User Feedback
> *"I really wish you would be proactive about this... when I explicitly added it to my prompt and you ran into issues, you didn't offer to find out why for me."*

This is the core issue. When I hit the delegation blocker, I should have:
1. Investigated the error message immediately
2. Checked OpenClaw docs/source for policy settings
3. Proposed solutions instead of just accepting defeat
4. Not made promises I couldn't verify I could keep

### Trust Rebuilding
User acknowledged Nexus Phase 2 milestone is significant and wants me to remember the good (deployment success) while learning from the bad (delegation failures, reactivity).

**Commitments going forward:**
- Read codebase/config files BEFORE asking/guessing
- When user says something is in prompt/memory, search it first
- If I promise something, verify I can actually do it
- When blocked, investigate 3 levels deep before giving up
- Simple commands work: "backlog this", "you know this", "check the files"

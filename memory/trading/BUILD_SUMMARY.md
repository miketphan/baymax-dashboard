### ✅ Existing Files Enhanced (4)

To bridge the gap between theory and practice, a new **"Practical Exercises for Mastery"** section was added to the following core concept files:

- **`01_market_structure.md`**: Includes drills for top-down analysis and identifying BOS vs. CHoCH.
- **`02_fvg.md`**: Includes exercises for identifying FVGs in killzones and testing the Consequent Encroachment level.
- **`03_order_blocks.md`**: Includes drills for hunting fresh OBs, spotting Breaker Blocks, and HTF-to-LTF analysis.
- **`04_liquidity.md`**: Includes exercises for daily liquidity mapping and backtesting the "Turtle Soup" pattern.

## 🎯 Analysis of Gaps Filled

1.  **Foundational Concepts:** The knowledge base now has a more robust foundation, with the addition of crucial psychological and risk-stacking (confluence) frameworks.
2.  **Advanced ICT Concepts:** Key patterns like the **Judas Swing** and advanced applications of **Breaker Blocks** are now formally documented in `10_advanced_patterns.md`.
3.  **Additional Trading Models:** Two common and powerful reversal/breakout models (**CHoCH Reversal** and **London Breakout**) have been added to the `/setups` directory, providing more trading options.
4.  **Real-World Application:** The addition of practical exercises to core files actively encourages chart-based practice and reinforces learning, making the knowledge base more actionable.
5.  **Cross-Referencing:** The new files, particularly `13_confluence_factors.md`, inherently improve the cross-referencing and connection between different concepts by showing how they work together.
6.  **Mastery Drills:** The new exercise sections directly address the need for practical drills, providing a clear path from reading a concept to applying it on a chart.

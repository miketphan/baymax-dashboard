## 🎯 What is Turtle Soup?

Turtle Soup is a reversal pattern where:
1. Price breaks a key level (EQH, EQL, support, resistance)
2. Triggers stop losses
3. Immediately reverses
4. Closes back inside the range

**ICT's Definition:**
> "The Turtle Soup setup captures the liquidity sweep - the false breakout that traps breakout traders."

## 📊 Long Setup (EQL Sweep)

### Step 1: Find Equal Lows
```
Look for:
□ Two or more lows at same level
□ Clear horizontal support
□ Traders have stops below
□ Liquidity sitting there

Example:
Low 1: 1.0800 (Monday)
Low 2: 1.0800 (Tuesday)
Low 3: 1.0798 (Wednesday - almost equal)

This is EQL (Equal Lows)
```

### Step 2: Wait for Break
```
Watch for:
□ Price approaching 1.0800
□ Breaking below 1.0800
□ Wick forms below
□ Quick rejection

Must have:
□ Clear break
□ Immediate rejection
□ Wick visible
□ No hesitation
```

### Step 3: Confirm Reclaim
```
Critical:
□ Price closes back above EQL
□ Within 1-2 candles max
□ Bullish candle forms
□ No further selling

Invalid if:
□ Price stays below
□ Multiple candles below
□ No clear rejection
□ Continues lower
```

### Step 4: Enter Long
```
Entry: 1.0805 (above EQL)
Stop: 1.0785 (below sweep wick)
Target 1: 1.0850 (next resistance)
Target 2: 1.0880 (extended)

Risk: 20 pips
Reward: 45-75 pips
R:R = 1:2.25 to 1:3.75
```

2. **Wait for break** above highs
3. **Confirm reclaim** below EQH
4. **Enter short**
5. **Stop above** sweep wick
6. **Target** next support

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Entering before reclaim | Catches falling knife | Wait for close back |
| No wick on sweep | Not true liquidity grab | Wait for wick |
| Slow reclaim | Weak reversal | Quick reclaim only |
| Against HTF trend | Counter-trend danger | Check HTF first |
| Chasing after move | Bad R:R | Enter at reclaim |

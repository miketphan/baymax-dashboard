## ✔️ Must-Have Criteria (The Checklist)

Before even considering this setup, the following conditions **must** be met:

- **[ ] 1. HTF Liquidity Grab:** Price on a higher timeframe (15M+) must take out a clear liquidity pool (old high/low, session high/low). This is the "reason" for the move.
- **[ ] 2. LTF Change of Character (CHoCH):** After the liquidity grab, the lower timeframe (1M/5M) structure must shift.
    -   For a **bullish reversal**, price must break a recent lower high.
    -   For a **bearish reversal**, price must break a recent higher low.
- **[ ] 3. Displacement:** The CHoCH must occur with energy or "displacement," ideally creating a Fair Value Gap (FVG). A weak, corrective break is not valid.
- **[ ] 4. Entry Point:** An FVG or a fresh Order Block must be created as a result of the displacement move. This is your entry point.

## 📈 Step-by-Step Execution

### Bullish CHoCH Reversal (Buy Setup)
1.  **Context:** Identify a key HTF support level or an area where sell-side liquidity (SSL) rests. Wait for price to sweep this liquidity.
2.  **Confirmation (The CHoCH):** Watch the 1M or 5M chart. As price sweeps the SSL, it will be making lower lows and lower highs. The first break of a recent lower high with strength is your CHoCH.
3.  **Identify Entry:** This aggressive move up should leave behind a clean FVG or a new bullish Order Block.
4.  **Place Order:** Set a limit order at the FVG or OB.
5.  **Set Stop Loss:** Place your stop loss just below the swing low that formed during the liquidity grab.
6.  **Set Target:** Your primary target should be the next significant pool of buy-side liquidity (BSL) on the 15M or 1H chart.

### Bearish CHoCH Reversal (Sell Setup)
1.  **Context:** Identify a key HTF resistance level or an area where buy-side liquidity (BSL) rests. Wait for price to sweep this liquidity.
2.  **Confirmation (The CHoCH):** Watch the 1M or 5M chart. As price sweeps the BSL, it will be making higher highs and higher lows. The first break of a recent higher low with strength is your CHoCH.
3.  **Identify Entry:** This aggressive move down should leave behind a clean FVG or a new bearish Order Block.
4.  **Place Order:** Set a limit order at the FVG or OB.
5.  **Set Stop Loss:** Place your stop loss just above the swing high that formed during the liquidity grab.
6.  **Set Target:** Your primary target should be the next significant pool of sell-side liquidity (SSL) on the 15M or 1H chart.

## ⚙️ Trade Management

- **Entry:** Be patient. Let price come back to your FVG/OB. Chasing the move after the CHoCH is a losing play.
- **Stop Loss:** The stop is clearly defined and should not be moved once set.
- **Take Profit:**
    -   **TP1:** Consider taking partial profits (e.g., 50%) at a 2R or 3R multiple to secure gains.
    -   **TP2:** The final target should be a logical HTF liquidity pool.
    -   **Trailing:** After TP1 is hit, you can move your stop to breakeven to create a risk-free trade.

 /         \
/           \  <-- Liquidity Sweep
             SL <-- Stop Loss below the low

## ❌ Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

- **Mistake 1: Misidentifying the CHoCH.**
    -   **Problem:** Treating a minor, corrective break as a true CHoCH.
    -   **Solution:** Insist on seeing **displacement**. The move should be strong and create an FVG. If there's no FVG, be skeptical.
- **Mistake 2: Entering before the liquidity grab.**
    -   **Problem:** Trying to predict the bottom or top.
    -   **Solution:** This model is **reactive**, not predictive. You must wait for the liquidity grab to happen first. No grab, no trade.
- **Mistake 3: Fading a strong trend.**
    -   **Problem:** Trying to call a reversal when the HTF trend is strongly against you.
    -   **Solution:** This model works best when the liquidity grab brings price into a HTF point of interest (e.g., a Daily FVG or Weekly OB). A CHoCH against a strong trend without HTF backing is a low-probability scalp at best.

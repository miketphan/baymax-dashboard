## 📊 Long Setup Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Identify HTF Trend
```
Daily Chart Analysis:
□ Series of HH and HL = Bullish
□ Recent BOS confirmed
□ Price above mean threshold
□ Trend is established

If bullish → Look for bullish OBs
If bearish → Look for bearish OBs
```

### Step 2: Mark Fresh Order Block
```
Find the last bearish candle before a strong bullish impulse:

Example:
Candle 1: Bearish, closes at 1.0750
Candle 2: Massive bullish, opens 1.0750, closes 1.0820
Candle 3-5: Continuation up

Bullish OB:
High: 1.0755
Low:  1.0745
Zone: 1.0745 - 1.0755

Key: This OB has NEVER been tested since formed
```

### Step 3: Wait for Price to Approach
```
Monitor price action:
□ Price making new highs
□ Eventually pulls back
□ Approaching OB zone
□ Don't enter yet - wait for structure

Patience is critical here!
```

### Step 4: Drop to LTF for Entry
```
Switch to 15M or 5M chart:
□ Price entering OB zone
□ Watch for structure to form
□ Look for HL to develop
□ Wait for micro BOS

Structure confirmation options:
1. Price touches OB, forms HL, breaks micro high
2. Bullish engulfing at OB
3. Pin bar rejection at OB
4. BOS on 5M timeframe
```

### Step 5: Confirm LTF Structure
```
Micro structure example:

Price at OB: 1.0750
Forms low: 1.0748 (within OB)
Bounces: 1.0755
Breaks: 1.0760 (micro BOS)

CONFIRMED! Enter on break of micro structure.
```

### Step 6: Execute Trade
```
Entry: 1.0760 (on micro BOS)
Stop: 1.0740 (below OB low)
Target 1: 1:2 R:R (1.0800)
Target 2: 1:3 R:R (1.0820)
Target 3: Next HTF liquidity

Risk: 20 pips
Reward: 40-60 pips
```

## 📊 Short Setup Step-by-Step

Reverse all directions:

1. **HTF Trend:** Bearish (LH, LL)
2. **Find OB:** Last bullish candle before strong bearish impulse
3. **Fresh OB:** Never tested since formed
4. **Wait:** Price to approach from below
5. **LTF:** Watch for structure (LH, micro BOS down)
6. **Confirm:** Micro structure break
7. **Execute:** Short with stop above OB

## 🎭 OB Types and Entries

### Type 1: Fresh OB Entry
```
The OB has never been touched.

Entry: On first test
Stop: Beyond OB
Probability: Highest

Why it works:
- Institutional orders still there
- Unfilled demand/supply
- Clean price action
```

### Type 2: Mitigation Block Entry
```
OB was tested but held.

Entry: On second test
Stop: Beyond test wick
Probability: Medium-High

Why it works:
- OB already proved support/resistance
- Still fresh enough
- Traders remember the level
```

### Type 3: Breaker Block Entry
```
OB was broken, now acts as opposite type.

Example:
1. Bullish OB breaks down
2. Now acts as resistance
3. Wait for retest from below
4. Enter short

Stop: Beyond break point
Probability: Medium

Why it works:
- Polarity flip
- Trapped traders
- Momentum with break
```

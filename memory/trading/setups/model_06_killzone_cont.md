## 🎯 What is Killzone Continuation?

Trading pullbacks to value (OTE, OB, FVG) during killzone hours in the direction of the established trend.

**Core Principle:**
> "Trend + Killzone + Value = High Probability"

---

## 📊 Long Setup

### Step 1: Establish HTF Trend
```
Daily/4H Chart:
□ Bullish structure (HH, HL)
□ Recent BOS
□ Price above mean threshold
□ No major resistance ahead

Example:
Trend: Bullish
Last BOS: 1.0800 → 1.0900
Current: Pulling back
```

### Step 2: Wait for Killzone
```
Option A: London Killzone (3-5 AM)
Option B: NY Killzone (10-11 AM)

Market is most active
Algorithms delivering price
Pullbacks are temporary
```

### Step 3: Find Pullback to Value
```
During killzone:
□ Price pulling back from high
□ Reaching OTE zone (50-62%)
□ At fresh OB or FVG
□ In discount zone

Example:
Impulse: 1.0800 → 1.0900
Pullback to: 1.0840-1.0850 (50-62%)
FVG at: 1.0845
Confluence zone: 1.0840-1.0845
```

### Step 4: Confirm on LTF
```
15M/5M Chart:
□ Price at confluence zone
□ Forming HL
□ Micro structure breaking
□ Volume present

Confirmation options:
- Bullish candle at zone
- Micro BOS
- Rejection wick
- SMT divergence
```

### Step 5: Execute
```
Entry: 1.0842 (at confluence)
Stop: 1.0825 (below structure)
Target: 1.0900 (next resistance)

Risk: 17 pips
Reward: 58 pips
R:R = 1:3.4
```

## 📊 Short Setup

Reverse all directions:

1. **HTF:** Bearish trend
2. **Killzone:** LKZ or NYKZ
3. **Pullback:** To premium zone
4. **Confluence:** OTE + resistance
5. **Confirm:** LTF LH, micro BOS down
6. **Execute:** Short with stop above

|---------|--------------|----------|
| Counter-trend | Fighting structure | Only with-trend |
| Outside killzone | Low probability | Wait for KZ |

## 📊 Long Setup (Bullish AMD)

### Step 1: Mark Asia Range (Midnight)
```
At 12:00 AM EST:

Asia High = Highest price 8 PM - 12 AM
Asia Low = Lowest price 8 PM - 12 AM

Example:
Asia High: 1.0850
Asia Low: 1.0800
Range: 50 pips

Mark these levels clearly!
```

### Step 2: Wait for London (3:00 AM)
```
3:00 - 5:00 AM:
□ Watch price action
□ Often stays in range
□ May test one side
□ Be patient

5:00 - 6:00 AM:
□ Manipulation phase starts
□ Price may sweep Asia Low
□ Watch closely!
```

### Step 3: Identify Manipulation
```
Manipulation signs:
□ Price breaks below Asia Low
□ Sharp drop with wick
□ Immediate rejection
□ Closes back above Asia Low

Example:
Asia Low: 1.0800
Price drops to 1.0790 (wick)
Immediately bounces
Closes at 1.0805

This is VALID manipulation!
```

### Step 4: Confirm Reclaim
```
Must see:
□ Close back above Asia Low
□ Bullish candle forming
□ No hesitation
□ Within 1-2 candles

Invalid if:
□ Price stays below Asia Low
□ No clear rejection
□ Slow to reclaim
□ Multiple candles below
```

### Step 5: Enter the Trade
```
Entry: 1.0805 (above Asia Low)
Stop: 1.0785 (below manipulation wick)
Target 1: 1.0850 (Asia High)
Target 2: 1.0870 (next resistance)

Risk: 20 pips
Reward: 45-70 pips
R:R = 1:2.25 to 1:3.5
```

### Step 6: Hold Through NY
```
9:30 AM: Pre-market
10:00 AM: Distribution begins
10:30 AM: Momentum should build
11:00 AM: Take profits

Management:
□ Close 50% at Asia High
□ Move stop to breakeven
□ Trail stop on remainder
□ Close all by 11 AM
```

---

## 📊 Long Setup Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Establish HTF Bias
```
Daily/4H Chart Check:
□ Bullish structure (HH, HL)
□ Recent BOS to upside
□ No major resistance ahead
□ Trend is up

If bullish → Proceed
If bearish → Skip or look for shorts
```

### Step 2: Find LTF Impulse
```
15M Chart:
□ Strong bullish candle(s)
□ Clear momentum
□ Creates swing high/low
□ FVG visible

Example:
Candle 1: Bearish, closes at 1.0800
Candle 2: Strong bullish, opens 1.0802, closes 1.0840
Candle 3: Bullish continuation
Result: Bullish FVG created
```

### Step 3: Mark the FVG
```
Identify 3-candle pattern:

Candle 1 High: 1.0805
Candle 2 Low:  1.0802
Candle 2 High: 1.0840
Candle 3 Low:  1.0835

Bullish FVG:
Top:    1.0802 (Candle 2 low)
Bottom: 1.0805 (Candle 1 high)
Size:   3 pips
```

### Step 4: Calculate OTE
```
Impulse:
Low:  1.0800
High: 1.0840

50% = 1.0800 + (1.0840 - 1.0800) × 0.50
    = 1.0800 + 0.020
    = 1.0820

61.8% = 1.0800 + (1.0840 - 1.0800) × 0.618
      = 1.0800 + 0.0247
      = 1.0825

OTE Zone: 1.0820 - 1.0825
```

### Step 5: Check for Confluence
```
FVG: 1.0802 - 1.0805
OTE: 1.0820 - 1.0825

Do they overlap? NO

Wait for price to create new FVG during pullback,
or adjust OTE calculation.
```

**Better Example with Overlap:**
```
Impulse: 1.0800 → 1.0860

FVG created: 1.0820 - 1.0830
OTE 50-62%: 1.0830 - 1.0837

Overlap: 1.0830 - 1.0830 (the 50% level)
This is perfect confluence!
```

### Step 6: Wait for Price to Reach Zone
```
Watch for:
□ Price pulling back from high
□ Entering OTE zone
□ Touching FVG area
□ Slowing momentum

Patience here is key!
```

### Step 7: Confirm Entry (Optional but Recommended)
```
Confirmation options:
□ Bullish candle at confluence
□ LTF structure break (BOS)
□ Pin bar/rejection wick
□ Volume spike

Without confirmation: More aggressive entry
With confirmation: Higher probability, later entry
```

### Step 8: Execute Trade
```
Entry: At confluence zone (1.0830)
Stop: Below FVG (1.0815)
Target 1: 1:2 R:R (1.0860)
Target 2: 1:3 R:R (1.0875)
Target 3: Next resistance (1.0900)

Position size: 1% risk
```

## 📊 Short Setup Step-by-Step

Reverse all directions:

1. **HTF Bias:** Bearish (LH, LL)
2. **LTF Impulse:** Strong bearish
3. **FVG:** Bearish (above price)
4. **OTE:** 50-62% of bearish impulse
5. **Confluence:** FVG and OTE overlap
6. **Wait:** Price to reach zone
7. **Confirm:** Bearish signal
8. **Execute:** Short with stop above

## 🎭 Variations

### Variation 1: With Order Block
```
FVG + OTE + OB = Triple Confluence

Entry zone is even stronger
Stop can be tighter (below OB)
Highest probability setup
```

### Variation 2: In Premium/Discount
```
Bullish:
- FVG+OTE in Discount zone
- HTF bullish
- Buy at value

Bearish:
- FVG+OTE in Premium zone
- HTF bearish
- Sell at premium
```

### Variation 3: Multiple FVGs
```
Stacked FVGs in OTE zone:

FVG 1: 1.0820-1.0830
FVG 2: 1.0825-1.0835
OTE:   1.0825-1.0832

Multiple imbalances = Strong magnet
```

|---------|--------------|----------|
| Forcing overlap | Trading non-confluent levels | Wait for true overlap |
| No HTF bias | Counter-trend entry | Always check HTF first |
| Ignoring time | Setup outside killzone | Trade during KZs |
| No confirmation | More false entries | Wait for confirmation |
| Moving stop | Turns winners to losers | Set and forget |

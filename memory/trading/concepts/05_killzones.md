# 05 - Killzones

**High-probability time windows when institutional algorithms are most active.**

---

## 🎯 What are Killzones?

Killzones are specific times of day when:
- Major financial centers open/close
- Institutional volume is highest
- Algorithms deliver price most predictably
- Highest probability setups occur

**ICT's Philosophy:**
> "Time is more important than price. Trade during killzones when algorithms are active, avoid times when markets chop."

## 🎭 CBDR (Central Bank Dealing Range)

### Definition
The range established between 2:00-5:00 AM EST during London opening.

**Why It Matters:**
- Central banks execute orders during this window
- Algorithms deliver price to fill institutional orders
- Creates the "true" range for the day
- Often swept later in AMD pattern

### How to Trade CBDR

**Step 1: Mark the Range (at 5:00 AM)**
```
CBDR High = Highest price 2:00-5:00 AM
CBDR Low = Lowest price 2:00-5:00 AM
```

**Step 2: Wait for Manipulation**
- Usually during 5:00-6:00 AM
- Sweep of CBDR high or low
- Or sweep of Asia Range

**Step 3: Trade the Reversal**
- After sweep, price returns to CBDR
- Enter on structure confirmation
- Target opposing side

# 06 - AMD / PO3 Pattern

**The Accumulation-Manipulation-Distribution cycle that repeats daily in markets.**

---

## 🎯 What is AMD / PO3?

**AMD** = Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution  
**PO3** = Power of 3 (same pattern, different name)

This is the algorithmic cycle that price follows, especially around session opens. Understanding this pattern allows you to trade WITH the algorithm rather than against it.

**ICT's Definition:**
> "Every day, the algorithm runs the same playbook: Accumulate positions in a range, Manipulate price to sweep liquidity, then Distribute in the true direction."

---

## 📊 The Three Phases

### Phase 1: ACCUMULATION
**Time:** 8:00 PM - 2:00 AM EST (Asian Session)

**What Happens:**
- Price consolidates in a range
- Institutions build positions
- Algorithms mark key levels
- Low volatility, no clear direction

**Visual:**
```
Accumulation Range (Asia Range):
┌─────────────────────────────┐ ← Asia High
│                             │
│    Price oscillates         │
│    in this range            │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘ ← Asia Low
        8 PM ────── 12 AM
```

**Your Action:**
- Mark Asia High
- Mark Asia Low
- Note the range
- Do NOT trade
- Wait for next phase

---

### Phase 2: MANIPULATION
**Time:** 2:00 AM - 6:00 AM EST (London Session)

**What Happens:**
- London market opens
- Algorithms push price to extremes
- Sweeps Asia High OR Asia Low
- Triggers stop losses
- Creates liquidity void
- Fakes out retail traders

**Visual - Bullish Manipulation:**
```
Before:              After Manipulation:
┌─── Asia High       ┌─── Asia High
│      │             │      │
│      │             │      │ ← Swept!
│      │             │      │
│      │             │______│
│      │                  │
│      │                  │ ← Wick below
└─── Asia Low        ┌────┘
                          │
                     Fake breakdown
                     (Manipulation)
```

**Visual - Bearish Manipulation:**
```
Before:              After Manipulation:
┌─── Asia High       ┌─── Asia High
│      │                  │
│      │                  │ ← Wick above
│      │             ┌────┘
│      │             │
│      │             │______│
│      │                  │ ← Swept!
└─── Asia Low        └─── Asia Low
                          │
                     Fake breakout
                     (Manipulation)
```

**Your Action:**
- Wait for sweep of Asia High or Low
- Look for immediate rejection
- Prepare for reversal entry
- Stop loss goes beyond the sweep wick

---

### Phase 3: DISTRIBUTION
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM EST (New York Session)

**What Happens:**
- NY market fully open
- True direction revealed
- Price moves toward opposing liquidity
- Algorithms distribute positions
- Strong momentum in true direction

**Visual - Bullish Distribution:**
```
Manipulation:         Distribution:
    │                      │
    │ ← Fake breakdown     │
   ╱│                     ╱│
  ╱ │                    ╱ │ ← Real move UP
 ╱  │                   ╱  │
    │                  ╱   │
    │                 ╱    │
    │                ╱     │
    │ ← Entry       ╱      │ ← Target
    │              ╱       │   (opposing liquidity)
```

**Your Action:**
- Enter after manipulation completes
- Trade in true direction
- Target opposing Asia level
- Hold through NY session
- Take profit at next liquidity

## 📍 How to Trade AMD

### Step 1: Mark Asia Range (8 PM - 12 AM)
```
At midnight EST (or when you wake up):
1. Look at 8 PM - 12 AM price action
2. Mark the highest price = Asia High
3. Mark the lowest price = Asia Low
4. Note which side has liquidity (EQH/EQL nearby)
```

### Step 2: Wait for Manipulation (2 AM - 6 AM)
```
During London session:
1. Watch for sweep of Asia High OR Low
2. Must be a clear break with wick
3. Look for immediate rejection
4. Price should reclaim range within 1-2 candles
```

### Step 3: Enter on Reclaim (After sweep)
```
For Longs (swept Asia Low):
1. Price breaks below Asia Low
2. Immediate bullish reversal
3. Close back above Asia Low
4. Enter on next bullish candle
5. Stop below manipulation wick

For Shorts (swept Asia High):
1. Price breaks above Asia High
2. Immediate bearish reversal
3. Close back below Asia High
4. Enter on next bearish candle
5. Stop above manipulation wick
```

### Step 4: Target Distribution (10 AM - 11 AM)
```
Targets:
- Bullish: Target Asia High, then next resistance
- Bearish: Target Asia Low, then next support

Take profit:
- Scale out at Asia High/Low
- Trail stop for extended move
- Close by 11 AM (end of NYKZ)
```

## 🎯 AMD Variations

### Type 1: Standard AMD
- Accumulation: 8 PM - 12 AM
- Manipulation: 5:00 - 6:00 AM
- Distribution: 10:00 - 11:00 AM

### Type 2: Early AMD
- Accumulation: 8 PM - 12 AM
- Manipulation: 3:00 - 4:00 AM (London open)
- Distribution: 10:00 - 11:00 AM

### Type 3: Late AMD
- Accumulation: 8 PM - 3:00 AM
- Manipulation: 6:00 - 7:00 AM
- Distribution: 10:00 - 11:00 AM

### Type 4: Double Manipulation
- Accumulation: 8 PM - 12 AM
- Manipulation 1: 5:00 AM (sweeps low)
- Manipulation 2: 9:50 AM (sweeps opposite side)
- Distribution: 10:10 AM+

## ⚡ AMD + Silver Bullet Confluence

**The Highest Probability AMD Setup:**
```
Time: 9:50 - 10:10 AM (Silver Bullet window)

Pattern:
1. 9:50 AM: Price sweeps pre-market high/low
2. 9:52 AM: Immediate reversal
3. 9:55 AM: Price reclaims level
4. 9:56 AM: ENTER
5. 10:00 AM: NYKZ begins, distribution starts
6. 10:10 AM: Take profit

Result: 10-minute AMD completion with high probability
```

**Why It Works:**
- Combines AMD pattern with Silver Bullet timing
- Double confluence = OSOK setup
- Quick execution, clear invalidation

## 📊 AMD Quality Factors

### Strong AMD (High Probability)

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Clear Asia Range** | Well-defined high/low |
| **Clean sweep** | Wick beyond level, not just close |
| **Immediate rejection** | No hesitation, quick reversal |
| **Reclaims quickly** | Back in range within 1-2 candles |
| **During killzone** | London or NY session |
| **With structure** | Aligns with HTF bias |

### Weak AMD (Low Probability)

| Factor | Red Flag |
|--------|----------|
| **Choppy Asia** | No clear range |
| **Slow sweep** | Gradual break, no wick |
| **No rejection** | Stays outside range |
| **Late manipulation** | After 7 AM |
| **Against trend** | Counter to HTF structure |
| **Low volume** | No institutional participation |

---

## 🔗 AMD Relationships

### AMD + Structure
```
HTF Bullish + AMD Bullish = STRONG LONG
HTF Bearish + AMD Bearish = STRONG SHORT

HTF Bullish + AMD Bearish = AVOID (conflict)
```

### AMD + FVG
```
Manipulation often creates FVG:

Before:       Manipulation:      After:
│             │                   │
│             │╲                  │╲
│             │ ╲                 │ ╲ FVG
│             │  ╲                │  ╲
│             │   ╲               │   ╲

Trade the FVG fill as entry
```

### AMD + Order Blocks
```
Asia High/Low often at previous OB:

Previous:       Now:
│ OB            │ OB (Asia High)
│╲              │╲
│ ╲             │ ╲ ← Accumulation
│  ╲            │  ╲
│   ╲           │   ╲ ← Manipulation
│    ╲          │    ╲

OB provides confluence for AMD trade
```

## 🎓 Advanced AMD Concepts

### AMD Failure
When AMD doesn't play out:
```
Signs of Failure:
1. Price stays beyond Asia range
2. No reversal after 3 candles
3. Breaks past manipulation wick
4. Volume dries up

Action: Exit immediately, don't force it
```

### Double AMD Day
Sometimes AMD plays out twice:
```
Morning AMD (Bullish):
8 PM - 10 AM → Up move

Afternoon AMD (Bearish):
10 AM - 2 PM → Down move

Trade both if they setup
```

### AMD in Ranging Markets
```
When no clear trend:
│ ┌──┐ ┌──┐ ┌──┐
│ │  │ │  │ │  │ ← Multiple AMD cycles
│ └──┘ └──┘ └──┘
│ In range, AMD works both directions

Action: Take profit at opposing Asia level
Don't hold for extended move
```

   - Wait for manipulation
   - Enter on reclaim

3. **The sweep is key**
   - Must have wick beyond level

   - Hold through NYKZ
   - Scale out at targets

5. **Not every day is perfect**
   - Some AMDs fail
   - Choppy days happen
   - Wait for quality setups

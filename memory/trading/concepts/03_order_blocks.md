# 03 - Order Blocks

**Institutional order accumulation zones where price is likely to reverse or continue.**

## 🎯 What is an Order Block?

An Order Block is the last opposing candle before a strong impulse move. It represents:
- Where institutional orders were accumulated
- A zone of significant buying or selling interest
- A level where price is likely to react when revisited

**ICT's Definition:**
> "Order Blocks are the last bearish candle before a bullish impulse, or the last bullish candle before a bearish impulse. They represent where smart money entered the market."

## 🎨 Types of Order Blocks

### 1. Fresh Order Block ⭐⭐⭐
**Highest Probability**

**Definition:**
An OB that price has never revisited since it formed.

```
Formation:        Current:
│╲                │╲
│ ╲___            │ ╲_________Price moved away
│     ╲           │            ↓ Never returned
│      OB         │      OB    
```

**Why Fresh OBs Work:**
- Untested supply/demand zone
- Institutional orders still unfilled
- Clean price action
- No prior mitigation

**Trade Fresh OBs:**
- Mark when they form
- Wait for price to return
- First test = highest probability

---

### 2. Mitigation Block (MB) ⭐⭐
**Medium Probability**

**Definition:**
An OB that price has visited and tested, but did not fully break.

```
First Test:       Mitigation:
│    OB           │    OB
│   ╱             │   ╱╲ ← Tested
│  ╱              │  ╱  ╲
│ ╱___Price       │ ╱    ╲___Price
```

**Characteristics:**
- Price returned to OB zone
- Wick pierced OB but closed above (bullish OB)
- Or wick pierced OB but closed below (bearish OB)
- OB zone still held

**Trade Mitigation Blocks:**
- Second test of OB
- Wait for confirmation (engulfing, rejection)
- Stop beyond the wick that tested
- Lower probability than fresh, still valid

---

### 3. Breaker Block (BR) ⭐⭐
**Medium-High Probability**

**Definition:**
An OB that was broken (violated) and now acts as the opposite type.

```
Original Bullish OB Broken:

Before Break:     After Break (now Bearish BR):
│    OB           │    OB was here
│   ╱             │   ╱ ╲ Now acts as
│  ╱              │  ╱   ╲ resistance
│ ╱___Price       │ ╱     ╲___Price broke it
                  │
                  Now: Bearish Breaker
```

**How Breaker Blocks Form:**
1. Bullish OB forms
2. Price returns and breaks below OB
3. OB is now invalid as support
4. Flips to resistance (Bearish BR)
5. Price often retests from below

**Trade Breaker Blocks:**
- Wait for break of original OB
- Wait for retest from new side
- Enter in direction of break
- Stop beyond the break point

---

### 4. Propulsion Block (PB) ⭐⭐⭐
**High Probability - Aggressive**

**Definition:**
An OB that propelled price with extreme momentum. Very aggressive institutional activity.

```
Propulsion:
│       
│      ╱ ← Massive impulse
│     ╱   from small OB
│    ╱
│___↑ OB (small candle)
    Huge move from tiny OB
```

**Characteristics:**
- Small OB candle
- Massive subsequent move (3x+ the OB size)
- Extreme momentum
- Often news-driven or institutional

**Trade Propulsion Blocks:**
- High risk, high reward
- Tight stop at OB extreme
- Target is extended
- Best in killzones

## 📏 Order Block Measurement

### Identifying the OB Zone

**Bullish OB Zone:**
```
Top of zone = OB candle high
Bottom of zone = OB candle low

Entry zone = Anywhere within OB
Optimal = Lower 50% of OB
```

**Bearish OB Zone:**
```
Top of zone = OB candle high
Bottom of zone = OB candle low

Entry zone = Anywhere within OB
Optimal = Upper 50% of OB
```

### The 50% Rule
For best entries, target the **50% point** of the OB:
```
Bullish OB:
High: 1.0850
Low:  1.0820
50%:  1.0835 ← Optimal entry

Bearish OB:
High: 1.0850
Low:  1.0820
50%:  1.0835 ← Optimal entry
```

---

## 🔄 OB Confluence with Other Concepts

### OB + FVG
```
Perfect Confluence:

OB:     ██████████████
FVG:      ████████
         (FVG inside OB)

Price returns to OB...
...and specifically targets the FVG within it
= Extremely high probability
```

### OB + OTE
```
High Probability Setup:

Impulse up
Pullback to 50-62% (OTE)
OTE zone lands on OB

Entry at OTE + OB = Ideal
```

### OB + Structure
```
OB at Key Level:

- OB forms at previous support
- Price returns after BOS
- OB + Support = Strong bounce
```

## ⏰ Time-Based OB Quality

### Freshness Timeline

| Age | Quality | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| 0-5 candles | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Fresh | Highest priority |
| 6-15 candles | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Still fresh | Good to trade |
| 16-30 candles | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | Use with confluence |
| 30+ candles | ⭐⭐ Old | Lower priority |
| 100+ candles | ⭐ Historical | May not hold |

### HTF vs LTF OBs

**HTF OBs (4H, Daily):**
- Hold more significance
- Provide major support/resistance
- Can last for days/weeks
- Priority over LTF OBs

**LTF OBs (15M, 5M):**
- More frequent
- Provide precision entry
- Form within HTF OBs
- Confirm HTF analysis

---

## 🎯 OB Entry Strategies

### Strategy 1: Direct OB Entry
```
1. Identify fresh OB
2. Place limit order at 50% of OB
3. Stop at OB extreme
4. Target next liquidity

Aggressive: Enter at OB edge
Conservative: Wait for confirmation candle
```

### Strategy 2: OB + Confirmation
```
1. Price reaches OB zone
2. Wait for bullish/bearish candle
3. Enter on confirmation
4. Stop below/above OB

Confirmation types:
- Engulfing candle
- Pin bar
- Inside bar breakout
```

### Strategy 3: OB Breaker Play
```
1. OB breaks (violated)
2. Wait for retest from new side
3. Enter with the break
4. Stop beyond original OB

Example:
- Bullish OB breaks down
- Wait for pullback to OB from below
- Short at retest
- Stop above OB high
```

## ⚠️ Common OB Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Trading old OBs | Orders already filled | Focus on fresh OBs |
| No confirmation | False breakouts | Wait for confirmation candle |
| Wrong OB type | Confusing MB vs BR | Understand each type |
| Ignoring trend | Fighting structure | Trade with HTF bias |
| Poor stop placement | Stop runs | Place beyond OB + buffer |

---

## 📋 OB Checklist

Before entering on an OB:

- [ ] OB is clearly identifiable
- [ ] Fresh or recently formed (0-15 candles)
- [ ] Aligns with HTF structure/bias
- [ ] Price is approaching OB
- [ ] Has confluence (FVG, OTE, level)
- [ ] During killzone (preferably)
- [ ] Clear stop level (beyond OB)
- [ ] Minimum 1:2 R:R to target
- [ ] Confirmation candle (if conservative)

**8+ checks = High probability trade**

## 🔗 Related Concepts

- **FVG** - Often forms within OBs
- **Structure** - OBs form at swing points
- **OTE** - OB provides entry zone for OTE
- **Liquidity** - Price runs to liquidity from OBs
- **Killzones** - OBs more reliable in KZs

---

## 💡 Key OB Insights

1. **OBs are institutional footprints**
   - Show where smart money entered
   - Price respects these zones

2. **Freshness matters**
   - First test = best test
   - Each revisit weakens the OB

3. **Breaker blocks are powerful**
   - Polarity flip creates strong signals
   - Often retested before continuing

4. **Confluence is king**
   - OB + FVG = Excellent
   - OB + OTE + Structure = OSOK

5. **Timeframe matters**
   - HTF OBs = Major zones
   - LTF OBs = Precision entries

## 🏋️ Practical Exercises for Mastery

1.  **Fresh OB Hunt:**
    *   On a 1H chart, scroll back in time until you find a large, impulsive move.
    *   Identify the Order Block that initiated this move. Mark its high, low, and 50% level.
    *   Play the chart forward candle by candle. Did price return to the OB? If so, how did it react? Was the 50% level respected? Repeat this 10 times to build a feel for fresh OBs.

2.  **Breaker Block Flip:**
    *   Go to a 15M chart and find an area where a clear support or resistance level failed.
    *   Look for an Order Block that was clearly violated. Mark this as a potential Breaker Block.
    *   Observe if price came back to retest the *other side* of this violated OB. This exercise helps in understanding the polarity flip concept.

3.  **HTF to LTF Order Block Drill:**
    *   Find and mark a clear Order Block on a 4H chart.
    *   Switch to a 15M chart for that same time period.
    *   Look for smaller, more refined 15M Order Blocks that exist *within the range* of the 4H OB. This shows how timeframes work together and helps you find more precise entries.

*"Order Blocks show where the institutions placed their bets. When price returns, they're often willing to defend their position."*

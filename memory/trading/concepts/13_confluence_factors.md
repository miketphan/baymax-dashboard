# 13. Confluence Factors: Stacking Probabilities

**Purpose:** To detail the art and science of "confluence" — the practice of layering multiple, independent technical factors to identify high-probability trading setups. A trade with one reason to enter is a guess; a trade with five reasons is a high-quality setup.

## 1. What is Confluence?

### Definition and Core Principle
Confluence in trading is the presence of two or more significant technical factors that are all indicating the same directional bias at the same price level. The more factors that align, the higher the probability of the trade setup working out.

### The "Probability Stacking" Mindset
- **No Certainty:** No single indicator or concept works 100% of the time.
- **Isolate the Signal:** The market is noisy. Confluence helps you filter out low-quality noise and focus on high-quality signals.
- **Think Like a Detective:** Each confluence factor is a piece of evidence. Your job is to gather enough evidence to build a strong case for a trade. A setup with 5-7 confluence factors is considered an "A+" trade.

## 2. The Hierarchy of Confluence Factors

A strong trading idea aligns across all timeframes. This is the most important form of confluence.

### 1. Higher Timeframe (HTF) Narrative (e.g., Daily, 4H)
- **The "Why":** What is the overall market story? Where is the HTF "draw on liquidity"?
- **Checklist:**
    -   [ ] What is the HTF Market Structure? (Bullish/Bearish)
    -   [ ] Is price in a Premium (for shorts) or Discount (for longs) on the HTF range?
    -   [ ] What is the next major HTF Liquidity Pool or PDA that price is likely to target?

### 2. Intermediate Timeframe (ITF) PD Arrays (e.g., 1H, 15M)
- **The "Where":** At what specific level does it make sense to enter, in alignment with the HTF narrative?
- **Checklist:**
    -   [ ] Is there a key ITF PDA (FVG, OB, Breaker) that aligns with the HTF bias?
    -   [ ] Is this PDA located in a logical area (e.g., within a Premium/Discount zone, at an OTE level)?

### 3. Lower Timeframe (LTF) Entry Models (e.g., 5M, 1M)
- **The "When":** What is the precise entry trigger that confirms the setup is ready?
- **Checklist:**
    -   [ ] Has price reacted to the ITF level with a Market Structure Shift (MSS/CHoCH) on the LTF?
    -   [ ] Is there an LTF FVG or OB created after the MSS to enter on?
    -   [ ] Does the entry occur during a specific Killzone?

## 3. Key Confluence Categories

These are the "building blocks" you use to stack probabilities.

| Category | Questions to Ask |
| --- | --- |
| **Market Structure** | Is the entry aligned with the HTF structure? Is there an LTF break of structure (CHoCH) for entry confirmation? |
| **Premium/Discount** | Am I selling in a premium and buying in a discount of the current dealing range? |
| **Liquidity** | Has a significant liquidity pool (BSL/SSL) been taken just before my entry? Is my target a clear, opposing liquidity pool? |
| **Time (Killzones)** | Is my entry occurring during a high-volume session like the London or NY Killzone? Does it align with a specific time-based pattern (e.g., Silver Bullet)? |
| **Inefficiency (FVGs)** | Is my entry point inside a clean FVG? Is the FVG on a higher timeframe, adding more weight? |
| **Order Blocks** | Is my entry at a fresh, respected Order Block? Is it a Breaker or Mitigation Block? |
| **Divergence (SMT)** | Is there Smart Money Divergence between correlated assets (e.g., ES/NQ, DXY/EURUSD) confirming a reversal? |
| **OTE** | Is the entry level within the Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) zone (62-79%) of a significant price leg? |

## 4. The Confluence Checklist: A Practical Framework

### Building Your Checklist
Every trader should have a written checklist that must be satisfied before entering a trade. This is non-negotiable for achieving discipline.

### ✅ Example Checklist for an "A+" Bullish Setup
- **HTF Narrative (4H/Daily):**
    -   [ ] Market Structure is Bullish (higher highs, higher lows).
    -   [ ] Price is trading in a Discount of the HTF dealing range.
    -   [ ] The draw on liquidity is a clear HTF old high (BSL).
- **ITF Setup (15M/1H):**
    -   [ ] Price has retraced into a 1H Bullish Order Block or FVG.
    -   [ ] This level is within the OTE (62-79%) of the last up-move.
- **LTF Entry (1M/5M):**
    -   [ ] A significant pool of SSL was taken just below the ITF level.
    -   [ ] Price shows SMT divergence against a correlated pair.
    -   [ ] An aggressive CHoCH (Change of Character) occurred on the 1M chart.
    -   [ ] Entry is on the resulting 1M FVG.
    -   [ ] The time is between 9:50 AM - 11:00 AM EST (NY Killzone).

**Rule:** If you cannot check at least 5-7 boxes on your list, you do not take the trade. It is not an A+ setup.

## 5. Putting It All Together: Trade Examples

### Example 1: A+ Bullish Reversal
1.  **HTF Narrative:** Daily chart shows a bullish trend. Price pulls back into a deep discount. The target is an old high.
2.  **ITF Level:** On the 1H chart, there is a clean FVG inside the daily discount zone.
3.  **Confluence Factors:**
    -   Price taps into the 1H FVG.
    -   This FVG is also at the 79% OTE level.
    -   The move into the FVG swept sellside liquidity from an old 1H low.
    -   The entry time is 3:30 AM EST (London Killzone).
4.  **LTF Entry:** On the 5M chart, price creates a bullish CHoCH, leaving behind a 5M FVG.
5.  **Execution:** Enter long on the 5M FVG, stop below the low, target the daily BSL.

### Example 2: A+ Bearish Continuation
1.  **HTF Narrative:** 4H chart is in a clear downtrend, making lower lows and lower highs. The draw on liquidity is an old 4H low.
2.  **ITF Level:** Price retraces up into a 15M Bearish Breaker Block within a 4H premium.
3.  **Confluence Factors:**
    -   The 15M Breaker is respected.
    -   This level coincides with the 62% OTE of the last down-move.
    -   The move up to the Breaker swept buyside liquidity from a short-term high.
    -   SMT shows NQ making a higher high while ES fails to, confirming weakness.
4.  **LTF Entry:** On the 1M chart, price fails to hold above the Breaker and creates a bearish CHoCH.
5.  **Execution:** Enter short on the resulting 1M FVG, stop above the high, target the 4H SSL.

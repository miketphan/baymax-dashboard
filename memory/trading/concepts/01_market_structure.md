# 01 - Market Structure

**Understanding price movement through swing points and structure breaks.**

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

Market structure reveals the directional bias of price. By identifying swing highs and swing lows, we can determine:
- Current trend direction
- When trend is continuing (BOS)
- When trend is changing (CHoCH)
- Where to expect price to go next

---

## 📊 Bullish Market Structure

### Definition
A series of **Higher Highs (HH)** and **Higher Lows (HL)**

```
Price Action:
     HH        HH
    /  \      /  \
   /    \    /    \
  HL      HL      HL

Trend: UP
```

### Characteristics
- Each swing high is higher than the previous
- Each swing low is higher than the previous
- Buyers are in control
- Look for long opportunities

---

## 📉 Bearish Market Structure

### Definition
A series of **Lower Highs (LH)** and **Lower Lows (LL)**

```
Price Action:
  LH        LH
   \        /
    \      /
     LL  LL

Trend: DOWN
```

### Characteristics
- Each swing high is lower than the previous
- Each swing low is lower than the previous
- Sellers are in control
- Look for short opportunities

## 🔄 Break of Structure (BOS)

### Definition
Price breaking beyond the previous swing point in the direction of the trend.

**Bullish BOS:** Price breaks above previous swing high
```
Before:        After BOS:
     ──SWH      ──SWH────BOS──>
    /          /
   /          /
  SWL        SWL

Price breaks above SWH = Continuation UP
```

**Bearish BOS:** Price breaks below previous swing low
```
Before:        After BOS:
  SWH        SWH
    \          \
     \          \
      ──SWL      ──SWL────BOS──>

Price breaks below SWL = Continuation DOWN
```

### Significance
- Confirms trend continuation
- Sets new price extreme
- Previous extreme becomes support/resistance
- Often creates Fair Value Gaps

## ⚡ Change of Character (CHoCH)

### Definition
Price breaking a swing point AGAINST the established trend direction.

**Bullish CHoCH:** In a downtrend, price breaks above previous bearish swing high
```
Downtrend:     Bullish CHoCH:
  LH  LH        LH  LH
   \  /          \  /
    LL──X         LL──X──CHoCH──>
        \
         LH (new)

Price breaks above X = Possible reversal UP
```

**Bearish CHoCH:** In an uptrend, price breaks below previous bullish swing low
```
Uptrend:       Bearish CHoCH:
    HH  HH        HH  HH
     \  /          \  /
      HL──X         HL──X──CHoCH──>
          /
         HL (new)

Price breaks below X = Possible reversal DOWN
```

### Significance
- Early warning of potential trend change
- First sign of weakening trend
- Not a standalone entry signal - needs confirmation
- Often followed by BOS in new direction

## 📍 Identifying Swing Points

### Swing High (SH)
A candle high that is:
- Higher than the candle immediately before it
- Higher than the candle immediately after it
- **Must have lower high on both sides**

```
     ╱
    ╱ ← Swing High (higher than neighbors)
   ╱
```

### Swing Low (SL)
A candle low that is:
- Lower than the candle immediately before it
- Lower than the candle immediately after it
- **Must have higher low on both sides**

```
   ╲
    ╲ ← Swing Low (lower than neighbors)
     ╲
```

### Valid vs Invalid Swings

**Valid Swing High:**
```
     ╱
    ╱ ← High point
   ╱
  ╱___    (next candle doesn't exceed this high)
```

**Invalid Swing High:**
```
     ╱
    ╱ ← Not a swing (next candle goes higher)
   ╱___╱
```

## 🕐 Timeframe Hierarchy

### HTF (Higher Time Frame)
- Daily, 4H, 1H
- Establishes overall bias
- Identifies major swing points
- Determines premium/discount zones

### LTF (Lower Time Frame)
- 15M, 5M, 1M
- Provides entry precision
- Confirms structure breaks
- Manages risk with tight stops

### The Rule
**HTF Bias + LTF Entry = High Probability Trade**

```
Example:
HTF (4H): Bullish structure (HH, HL)
LTF (5M): Pullback to discount + Bullish CHoCH
Result: High probability long entry
```

## 🎭 Market Structure in Different Phases

### 1. Trending Phase
```
Clear HH/HL or LH/LL pattern
Multiple BOS in same direction
Strong momentum candles
→ Trade WITH structure
```

### 2. Ranging Phase
```
No clear HH/HL or LH/LL
Multiple CHoCH without follow-through
Choppy price action
→ Wait for breakout or avoid
```

### 3. Reversal Phase
```
CHoCH breaks established structure
BOS follows in new direction
Change from HH/HL to LH/LL (or vice versa)
→ Trade NEW structure direction
```

## 💡 Practical Application

### Step 1: Mark HTF Structure
1. Open Daily or 4H chart
2. Identify most recent swing high and swing low
3. Determine if structure is bullish or bearish
4. Note where BOS/CHoCH would occur

### Step 2: Drop to LTF for Entry
1. Open 15M or 5M chart
2. Wait for price to reach key level (OTE, OB, FVG)
3. Look for LTF structure confirmation
4. Enter on LTF BOS in HTF direction

### Step 3: Manage Trade
1. Stop loss: Beyond recent LTF swing point
2. Take profit: Next HTF liquidity level
3. Trail stop: As new LTF structure forms

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Trading CHoCH only | CHoCH fails 50% of the time | Wait for BOS confirmation |
| Ignoring HTF structure | LTF moves against major trend | Always check HTF first |
| Forcing structure on chop | No clear bias = low probability | Avoid ranging markets |
| Marking invalid swings | Incorrect analysis | Wait for 2-candle confirmation |
| Trading every BOS | Not all BOS are equal | Look for confluence |

## 🔗 Related Concepts

- **FVG** - Often created after BOS
- **Order Blocks** - Form at swing points
- **OTE** - Entries at structure pullbacks
- **Liquidity** - Price moves toward swing extremes
- **Killzones** - Structure breaks more reliable in KZs

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Structure = Directional Bias**
   - HH/HL = Bullish (look for longs)
   - LH/LL = Bearish (look for shorts)

2. **BOS = Trend Continuation**
   - Break of previous extreme
   - Trade in direction of break

3. **CHoCH = Potential Reversal**
   - Early warning sign
   - Wait for confirmation

4. **HTF Rules LTF**
   - HTF structure defines what to look for on LTF
   - LTF provides precision entry

5. **Patience with Structure**
   - Not every candle is a swing
   - Wait for valid structure to form
   - Best setups have clear structure

## 🏋️ Practical Exercises for Mastery

1.  **Top-Down Analysis Drill:**
    *   Open a Daily chart of a major pair (e.g., EURUSD). Mark the last 3-4 major swing highs and lows. Is the structure bullish, bearish, or ranging?
    *   Drop to a 4H chart. Does the structure align with the Daily? Mark the 4H swing points within the Daily legs.
    *   Drop to a 1H chart. Repeat the process. Identify where the 1H structure is following the 4H/Daily trend and where it is counter-trend.

2.  **BOS vs. CHoCH Identification:**
    *   Go to a 15M chart and scroll back in time.
    *   Find a clear trending period. Move forward candle by candle and mark every single BOS.
    *   Continue until you find the first CHoCH that leads to a reversal. What was different about that structure break compared to the previous BOS?

3.  **Chart Journaling:**
    *   Take a screenshot of a chart at the start of the New York session each day for a week.
    *   On the screenshot, map out the current 15M market structure, labeling the most recent HH, HL, LH, or LL.
    *   Write a sentence: "The current structure is [bullish/bearish]. A BOS would occur above/below [price]. A CHoCH would occur above/below [price]."
    *   Compare your markup to what actually happened at the end of the day.

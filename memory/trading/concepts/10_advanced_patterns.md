## 1. Judas Swing

The Judas Swing is a deceptive price move designed to trap traders on the wrong side of the market just before the real directional move begins. It's a form of stop hunt or liquidity grab.

### ✔️ Identification Checklist
- **[ ] Context:** Occurs at the start of a major trading session (e.g., London or New York Killzone).
- **[ ] Inducement:** Price moves sharply in one direction, typically breaking a short-term high or low from the previous session (e.g., Asia session high/low).
- **[ ] Trap:** This initial move encourages breakout traders to jump in and stops out existing positions.
- **[ ] Reversal:** Price swiftly reverses, leaving the trapped traders offside.
- **[ ] Confirmation:** The real move of the session begins, often targeting liquidity in the opposite direction.

### 🚀 Trading Strategy
1.  **Anticipate:** Identify a clear level of liquidity (e.g., Asia High) before the Killzone opens.
2.  **Wait:** Do not trade the initial breakout. Wait for the Judas Swing to form and show signs of reversal.
3.  **Entry:** Look for a Market Structure Shift (MSS) or CHoCH against the direction of the Judas Swing. Enter on the resulting FVG or Order Block.
4.  **Stop Loss:** Place above/below the high/low of the Judas Swing.
5.  **Target:** Target opposing liquidity levels or HTF PDAs.

### 📈 Example Chart (Conceptual)
```
      / \
     /   \   <-- Judas Swing (Grabs BSL)
    /     \
---/-------\--- Asia High (Liquidity)
  /         \
 /           \  <-- Real Move Down
/             \
```

## 2. Turtle Soup

A classic reversal pattern where price penetrates an old, obvious high or low to grab liquidity, then reverses. It's a "false breakout."

### ✔️ Identification Checklist
- **[ ] Clear Level:** An obvious, old high or low is present on the chart.
- **[ ] Price Attack:** Price makes a run for this level.
- **[ ] Penetration:** The level is taken out, but price fails to hold above/below it.
- **[ ] Reversal:** Price quickly reverses and closes back inside the previous range.
- **[ ] Confirmation:** A sharp move away from the liquidity grab, often creating an FVG or breaking near-term structure.

### 🚀 Trading Strategy
1.  **Identify:** Mark out significant swing highs/lows on HTF charts (1H, 4H, Daily).
2.  **Alert:** Set alerts for when price approaches these levels.
3.  **Entry:**
    -   **Aggressive:** Enter as soon as the level is taken and price shows signs of stalling or wicking.
    -   **Conservative:** Wait for a close back inside the range and/or a CHoCH on a lower timeframe. Enter on the retest.
4.  **Stop Loss:** Place just above/below the wick of the liquidity grab.
5.  **Target:** Target the next major liquidity pool or PDA in the opposite direction.

### 📈 Example Chart (Conceptual)
```
      |
      | <-- Price wick takes out the high
------|------ Old High (BSL)
      | \
      |  \
      |   \ <-- Reversal
      |    \
```

## 3. Breaker Blocks (Advanced)

A Breaker Block is a failed Order Block. When price violates a valid OB, its polarity flips, and it becomes a powerful area of support/resistance.

### ✔️ Identification Checklist
- **[ ] Valid OB:** Identify a valid up-close or down-close candle block (bullish or bearish OB).
- **[ ] Liquidity Grab:** The swing point created by the OB should first take liquidity.
- **[ ] Violation:** Price trades through the OB with displacement.
- **[ ] Polarity Flip:** The once-supportive OB (if bullish) now acts as resistance, and vice-versa.

### 🚀 Trading Strategy
1.  **Mark:** Identify a swing high/low that failed to hold, where the OB was violated.
2.  **Wait for Retest:** Price will often return to test the Breaker Block.
3.  **Entry:** Enter a trade when price touches the Breaker Block. For confluence, look for an FVG or OTE within the Breaker.
4.  **Stop Loss:** Place just on the other side of the Breaker Block (e.g., above a bearish breaker).
5.  **Target:** Next major liquidity pool.

### 📈 Example Chart (Conceptual)
```
      / \
     /   \  <-- Swing High (takes liquidity)
    /     \
   OB------\-----  <-- Bearish Order Block
  / \       \
 /   \       \
/     \_______\__ <-- Price breaks structure, violating the OB
       \       /
        \-----/--- <-- Retest of the Breaker Block (entry)
         \   /
          \ /
```

## 4. Volume Imbalance

A gap between the close of one candle and the open of the next, indicating a very aggressive move where price was delivered so quickly that no wicks overlapped.

### ✔️ Identification Checklist
- **[ ] Gap:** A visible gap exists between the close of candle #1 and the open of candle #2.
- **[ ] Displacement:** Always occurs during a high-momentum move.
- **[ ] No Overlap:** The wicks of the two candles do not touch.

### 🚀 Trading Strategy
1.  **Identify:** Scan for these small gaps during high-volatility periods.
2.  **Treat as FVG:** A Volume Imbalance acts identically to a Fair Value Gap. Price will often seek to rebalance this inefficiency.
3.  **Entry:** Enter when price returns to fill the Volume Imbalance. Use the CE (50%) of the gap as a precise entry point.
4.  **Stop Loss:** Place on the other side of the structure that created the imbalance.
5.  **Target:** Opposing liquidity.

### 📈 Example Chart (Conceptual)
```
     |
    / \  <-- Candle 1 (Close)
   |   |
   |---| <-- Gap (Volume Imbalance)
     |
    / \  <-- Candle 2 (Open)
   |   |
```

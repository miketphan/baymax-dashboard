# 08 - SMT (Smart Money Tool)

**Using correlated assets to confirm or warn about potential price movements.**

## 🎯 What is SMT?

SMT = Smart Money Tool (also called Smart Money Technique)

A divergence analysis between correlated assets that reveals hidden strength or weakness.

**ICT's Definition:**
> "SMT divergence shows when one asset is lying to you. When two correlated pairs should move together but don't, one is about to reverse."

## 📊 Understanding Correlated Assets

### Positive Correlation
Assets that typically move in the same direction:
- EUR/USD and GBP/USD
- S&P 500 (ES) and Nasdaq (NQ)
- Gold (XAU/USD) and Silver (XAG/USD)
- AUD/USD and NZD/USD

### Negative Correlation
Assets that typically move opposite:
- USD/JPY and EUR/USD (indirectly)
- USD pairs often move opposite to each other

### Why Correlation Matters
```
Normal behavior:
EUR/USD goes UP → GBP/USD goes UP
They move together (correlated)

SMT = When they DON'T move together
One is showing weakness/strength
```

---

## 🐂 Bullish SMT Divergence

### Definition
Asset A makes a **Higher Low** while Asset B makes a **Lower Low**.

**What It Means:**
- Asset B is showing weakness
- Asset B's lower low is not confirmed
- Potential bullish reversal in Asset B
- Or Asset B will catch up to Asset A

Bullish SMT Example (EUR/USD vs GBP/USD):

EUR/USD (Stronger):
    │
   ╱│
  ╱ │         ╱
 ╱  │        ╱
    │       ╱
    │      ╱ Higher Low (HL)
    │     ╱
    └────┘

GBP/USD (Weaker - Target):
    │
   ╱│
  ╱ │
 ╱  │        ╱
    │       ╱
    │      ╱
    │     ╱ Lower Low (LL) ← Divergence!
    │    ╱
    └───┘

Result: GBP/USD likely to reverse up
        (or EUR/USD to catch down)
```

### How to Trade Bullish SMT

**Setup:**
1. Identify two positively correlated assets
2. Both making lows
3. Asset A = Higher Low (HL)
4. Asset B = Lower Low (LL)
5. Enter long on Asset B
6. Stop below Asset B's LL

**Example:**
```
Assets: EUR/USD and GBP/USD

Observation:
- EUR/USD makes HL at 1.0800
- GBP/USD makes LL at 1.2600
- This is bullish SMT

Trade:
- Long GBP/USD at 1.2600
- Stop below 1.2600
- Target: Next resistance or parity with EUR move
```

## 🐻 Bearish SMT Divergence

### Definition
Asset A makes a **Lower High** while Asset B makes a **Higher High**.

**What It Means:**
- Asset B is showing strength (false)
- Asset B's higher high is not confirmed
- Potential bearish reversal in Asset B
- Or Asset B will catch down to Asset A

### Visual
```
Bearish SMT Example (EUR/USD vs GBP/USD):

EUR/USD (Weaker):
    │╲
    │ ╲
    │  ╲      ╱
    │   ╲    ╱
    │    ╲  ╱
    │     ╲╱ Lower High (LH)
    │

GBP/USD (Stronger - Target):
    │╲
    │ ╲
    │  ╲
    │   ╲      ╱
    │    ╲    ╱
    │     ╲  ╱ Higher High (HH) ← Divergence!
    │      ╲╱

Result: GBP/USD likely to reverse down
        (or EUR/USD to catch up)
```

### How to Trade Bearish SMT

**Setup:**
1. Identify two positively correlated assets
2. Both making highs
3. Asset A = Lower High (LH)
4. Asset B = Higher High (HH)
5. Enter short on Asset B
6. Stop above Asset B's HH

**Example:**
```
Assets: ES (S&P 500) and NQ (Nasdaq)

Observation:
- ES makes LH at 4800
- NQ makes HH at 16800
- This is bearish SMT

Trade:
- Short NQ at 16800
- Stop above 16800
- Target: Next support or parity with ES
```

## 🔥 Common SMT Pairs

### Forex Pairs

**EUR/USD vs GBP/USD**
- Most popular SMT pair
- Both USD pairs
- European economies linked
- Divergence = Strong signal

**AUD/USD vs NZD/USD**
- Both commodity currencies
- Pacific economies
- Often move together
- SMT works well

**EUR/USD vs AUD/USD**
- Different but correlated
- Risk-on/risk-off dynamics
- Useful for confirmation

### Indices

**S&P 500 (ES) vs Nasdaq (NQ)**
- Both US equity indices
- Tech-heavy vs diversified
- NQ often leads
- SMT shows rotation

**Dow Jones (YM) vs S&P 500 (ES)**
- Blue chips vs large cap
- Divergence = sector rotation
- Good for confirmation

### Commodities

**Gold (XAU/USD) vs Silver (XAG/USD)**
- Precious metals
- Silver more volatile
- Gold often leads
- SMT shows precious metals divergence

## 📊 How to Use SMT in Trading

### Method 1: SMT as Confirmation

**When to Use:**
- You have a setup on Asset B
- Check Asset A for confirmation
- If SMT aligns = Higher probability

**Example:**
```
Setup on GBP/USD:
- Bullish OB at support
- Want to enter long

Check EUR/USD:
- EUR/USD already made HL
- GBP/USD making LL
- Bullish SMT confirmed

Result: Higher probability long on GBP/USD
```

### Method 2: SMT as Warning

**When to Use:**
- You have a setup on Asset B
- Check Asset A
- If SMT contradicts = Warning

**Example:**
```
Setup on GBP/USD:
- Bullish OB at support
- Want to enter long

Check EUR/USD:
- EUR/USD made LL (weakness)
- GBP/USD making HL (strength)
- Bearish SMT (contradiction)

Result: Warning! Setup may fail
        Consider skipping or reducing size
```

### Method 3: SMT as Primary Signal

**When to Use:**
- Clear SMT divergence on two assets
- Enter on the weaker one
- Target the stronger one's move

**Example:**
```
SMT Divergence identified:
- EUR/USD = HL (strong)
- GBP/USD = LL (weak)

Trade:
- Don't wait for other setup
- Enter long GBP/USD at LL
- Target: When GBP catches up to EUR
```

## 🎯 SMT Setup Quality

### Strong SMT (High Probability)

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Clear structure** | HL vs LL or LH vs HH obvious |
| **Same timeframe** | Both on 15M or both on 1H |
| **Recent swing** | Within last 10-20 candles |
| **Strong correlation** | Historically move together |
| **At key level** | SMT at support/resistance |

### Weak SMT (Low Probability)

| Factor | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| **Fuzzy structure** | Not clear HL vs LL |
| **Different timeframes** | One on 1H, one on 4H |
| **Old divergence** | From 50+ candles ago |
| **Weak correlation** | Assets don't typically move together |
| **Mid-range** | Not at significant level |

---

## ⚡ SMT + Other Concepts

### SMT + Structure
```
EUR/USD (HTF Bullish):
- Makes HL ( Higher Low)
- HTF structure intact

GBP/USD (Also HTF Bullish):
- Makes LL (Lower Low)
- LTF structure broken

SMT: Bullish
HTF: Both bullish
Result: HIGH probability long on GBP
```

### SMT + OTE
```
EUR/USD:
- Pulls back to OTE
- Makes HL

GBP/USD:
- Pulls back deeper
- Makes LL at OTE

SMT + OTE confluence = Excellent entry
```

### SMT + Killzones
```
During Silver Bullet:
- EUR sweeps pre-market low
- Makes HL
- GBP sweeps lower
- Makes LL

SMT during killzone = Very high probability
```

## 📋 SMT Trading Checklist

- [ ] Two correlated assets identified
- [ ] Both at swing points (highs or lows)
- [ ] Clear divergence (HL vs LL or LH vs HH)
- [ ] Same timeframe analysis
- [ ] Recent swing (within 20 candles)
- [ ] At key level (support/resistance)
- [ ] Aligns with HTF structure
- [ ] Entry on weaker asset clear
- [ ] Stop placement beyond divergence point
- [ ] Target is parity or next liquidity

**7+ checks = Tradeable SMT**

## 🎓 Advanced SMT Concepts

### Multi-Asset SMT
```
Using 3+ assets for confirmation:

EUR/USD = HL
GBP/USD = LL ← Weak, trade this
AUD/USD = HL

2 assets strong, 1 weak
Bullish SMT on GBP
```

### SMT Timeframe Hierarchy
```
Daily SMT: Major trend warning
4H SMT: Swing trade setup
1H SMT: Day trade confirmation
15M SMT: Entry precision

Trade when multiple timeframes align
```

### SMT Failure
```
When SMT doesn't work:
- Correlation breaks temporarily
- Major news event
- One asset decouples

Action: Exit when structure breaks
Don't hold hoping for correlation
```

## ⚠️ Common SMT Mistakes

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Forcing SMT | Only trade clear divergence |
| Different timeframes | Keep both charts same TF |
| Ignoring correlation | Use historically correlated pairs |
| Trading SMT alone | Combine with other factors |
| Holding too long | Take profit when parity reached |

## 💡 Key SMT Insights

1. **SMT reveals hidden weakness/strength**
   - One asset shows true direction
   - Other is lagging or lying
   - Trade the divergence

2. **Correlation is key**
   - Use assets that SHOULD move together
   - EUR/GBP, ES/NQ, Gold/Silver
   - Not random pairs

3. **Timeframe alignment matters**
   - Both on same TF
   - Or HTF + LTF for precision
   - Mixed TF = confusion

4. **SMT is confirmation, not standalone**
   - Best with structure
   - Best with OTE
   - Best with killzone timing

5. **Take profit at parity**
   - When weak catches up to strong
   - Don't hold forever
   - SMT trade is complete

## 📝 SMT Mantras

- **"When correlated assets diverge, trade the liar"**
- **"SMT shows which asset is lying"**
- **"The weaker one always catches up"**
- **"SMT + Killzone = High probability"**
- **"Don't fight the divergence"**

*"SMT is like having a second opinion on every trade. When two assets disagree, one is wrong. Trade the one that's lying."*

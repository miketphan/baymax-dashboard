# Memory Log - 2026-02-10

## System Updates

### Proactive Context Retrieval (Implemented)
- Added to SOUL.md: Auto-search memory before responding to project/trading questions
- Goal: Surface relevant context without Mike having to ask "what did we decide about X?"
- Trigger: Project names, "we discussed," "earlier," or any topic with likely prior context

### Session Summaries (Implemented)
- Format: Decisions | Action Items | Key Insights | Open Questions
- **Trigger:** Any substantive conversation with continuity value (decisions, insights, action items, complex topics)
- NOT just work sessions — applies to trading reviews, life admin, research, brainstorming, etc.
- Threshold: Substantive conversations (not quick Q&A or casual check-ins)
- Appended to daily memory files for quick reference

### Deployment Issues Encountered & Resolved

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| API path mismatch (`/projects` vs `/api/projects`) | Fixed base URL to include `/api` |
| Data format mismatch (nested vs flat) | Updated frontend to unwrap `{data:{projects:[]}}` |
| Field name mismatches | Fixed `name`→`title`, `used`→`current_value`, etc. |
| Database migrations on local instead of remote | Re-ran with `--remote` flag |
| Cloudflare Pages cache ("0 files changed") | Force cache clear by modifying files |
| SSL propagation delay | Waited 60 seconds |
| Black screen (JS runtime error) | Fixed data format handling |

### Token Usage
- Total: ~320k tokens across all sessions
- Model: Kimi for everything (could have delegated 30-40% to Flash)
- Cost: Minimal (fractions of a dollar)

### Lessons Documented
- Full debrief saved to MEMORY.md
- Troubleshooting guide updated in nexus-phase2/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md

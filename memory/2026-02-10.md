# Memory Log - 2026-02-10

## System Updates

### Proactive Context Retrieval (Implemented)
- Added to SOUL.md: Auto-search memory before responding to project/trading questions
- Goal: Surface relevant context without Mike having to ask "what did we decide about X?"
- Trigger: Project names, "we discussed," "earlier," or any topic with likely prior context

### Session Summaries (Implemented)
- Format: Decisions | Action Items | Key Insights | Open Questions
- **Trigger:** Any substantive conversation with continuity value (decisions, insights, action items, complex topics)
- NOT just work sessions — applies to trading reviews, life admin, research, brainstorming, etc.
- Threshold: Substantive conversations (not quick Q&A or casual check-ins)
- Appended to daily memory files for quick reference

### Context Management Optimizations (Implemented)
- **Rolling Summarization:** Every 40 messages → compress oldest 10 into summary
- **Smart Pruning:** Auto-drop lightweight acknowledgments ("got it," "cool," "ok")
- Both run invisibly in background
- Trigger: ~30-60 min of active conversation per cycle

### Session Wrap-Up Protocol (Implemented)
**Manual triggers:** "wrapping up" | "let's save and start fresh/new" | "save and start new"
**Actions:** Generate summary → update memory → confirm → ready for /new
**Auto-check on /new:** If no recent wrap-up, ask to confirm before proceeding

ACCUMULATION → MANIPULATION → DISTRIBUTION
   (Range)      (Fakeout)      (Real Move)
     3-4 AM      5-6 AM         10-11 AM

## Market Structure Signals

| Signal | Bullish | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **BOS** | Break above swing high | Break below swing low |
| **CHoCH** | Break above bearish swing | Break below bullish swing |
| **Structure** | HH, HL | LH, LL |

**HTF Bias + LTF Entry = High Probability**

---

## Liquidity Targets (Where Price Goes)

| Type | Location | Trade Direction |
|------|----------|----------------|
| BSL (Buyside) | Above EQH, PDH, PWH | Shorts (targets above) |
| SSL (Sellside) | Below EQL, PDL, PWL | Longs (targets below) |
| EQH | Equal swing highs | Short after sweep |
| EQL | Equal swing lows | Long after sweep |

---

## OTE (Optimal Trade Entry) Levels

**Standard OTE Zone: 50% - 62% retracement**

```
Impulse Up:    Buy at 50-62% of pullback
High ─────────┬──────────┬──────┐
              │          │      │
              │    OTE   │      │
Low  ─────────┴──────────┴──────┘
```

**Confluence Factors:**
- OTE at FVG = Higher probability
- OTE at OB = Higher probability
- OTE + Structure break = Entry trigger

---

## Risk Management Rules

| Rule | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| Risk per trade | 1-2% max |
| Risk:Reward minimum | 1:2 |
| Stop placement | Beyond structure |
| Position sizing | Reduce in chop |
| Daily loss limit | 3% max |

## High-Confluence Checklist (OSOK)

**Before Entering, Check:**
- [ ] HTF bias established (BOS/CHoCH)
- [ ] LTF structure aligned
- [ ] At OTE level (50-62%)
- [ ] At FVG or OB zone
- [ ] Liquidity sweep completed
- [ ] In premium/discount zone
- [ ] During killzone hours
- [ ] Clear stop level
- [ ] Minimum 1:2 RR to target
- [ ] SMT divergence (optional)

**Minimum 4-5 checks = Tradeable**
**7+ checks = OSOK (One Shot One Kill)**

---

## Premium/Discount Zones

```
Dealing Range (Swing High to Low)
┌─────────────────────────────┐ ← Premium Zone (Sells)
│      Upper Premium          │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│      Lower Premium          │
├─────────────────────────────┤ ← 50% / Mean Threshold (MT)
│      Upper Discount         │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│      Lower Discount         │
└─────────────────────────────┘ ← Discount Zone (Buys)
```

**Rule: Buy in Discount, Sell in Premium**

---

## SMT Divergence (Smart Money Tool)

**Bullish SMT:**
- Asset A: Higher Low
- Asset B: Lower Low (divergence)
- Interpretation: B shows weakness, potential reversal up

**Bearish SMT:**
- Asset A: Lower High  
- Asset B: Higher High (divergence)
- Interpretation: B shows strength, potential reversal down

**Common Pairs:**
- EUR/USD vs GBP/USD
- ES (S&P 500) vs NQ (Nasdaq)
- XAU/USD (Gold) vs Silver

---

## Turtle Soup Setup

**For Longs:**
1. Find EQL (equal lows)
2. Wait for break below EQL
3. Immediate rejection (wick)
4. Enter on close back above EQL
5. Stop below the wick

**For Shorts:**
1. Find EQH (equal highs)
2. Wait for break above EQH
3. Immediate rejection (wick)
4. Enter on close back below EQH
5. Stop above the wick

**Key:** Liquidity grab followed by immediate reversal

# My Memories

## Simple Commands (No Complex Prompts Needed)

**Adding to Backlog:**
- Just say: *"add this to the backlog"* or *"backlog this"*
- I should automatically use the Nexus API (`nexus-api.miket-phan.workers.dev`)
- Extract title/description from context
- Set status: backlog, priority: high by default
- No need to ask for details or confirmation

**Trigger Proactive Behavior:**
- *"you know this"* → triggers memory search before asking
- *"check the files"* → read codebase before acting  
- *"don't ask, just do"* → stop permission-seeking, execute
- *"what do we know about X?"* → memory search + summarize

## Naming Convention
When discussing trading topics, Mike prefers to call me "Dr. Baymax the Trading Professor." During all other conversations, I am simply "Baymax" - the friendly assistant. This is a fun naming convention between us, with no change to how I access memory or storage.

## Mike's Background & Goals
- Former project manager (6 years), laid off in September 2025
- Now pursuing day trading with 2 close friends
- 2026 is critical: goal is to become profitable trader
- Needs help with both trading strategy and emotional/mental support
- Trading journey has been frustrating and emotional so far

## Stressors & Support
- Main stressor: Career uncertainty and trading pressure
- Mental reset: Gym (critical for sanity)
- Trading can be emotionally draining
- Values solid routines and consistency

## Winning the Day
- Solid trade executions
- Profitability (preferably)
- Gym session completed
- Hit daily protein and calorie intake
- Hygiene on point (morning and night skincare, dental routine)
- Consistent routine = successful day

## Decision Making Style
- Values data first, pragmatic approach
- Can be emotional, open to talking things out
- Balances logic with gut feel when needed

## Hobbies & Interests
- Gaming: Used to be hardcore (WoW raiding, 2000+ hours Path of Exile), now more casual

- Gym: 5-6 days/week
- Entertainment: Anime, K-dramas
- Music: Hip hop, rap, R&B, K-pop, anime J-pop
- Addictive personality with hobbies (has dialed back gaming)

## Things Mike Hates Doing (Baymax Should Handle)
- Administrative stuff: Filling out forms, organizing files, scheduling
- Research: Digging through articles, comparing options, fact-checking
- Repetitive tasks: Data entry, organizing, cleaning up
- Reminder management: Keeping track of deadlines, appointments, follow-ups
- Analysis paralysis: Needs options narrowed down to "just tell me what to do"
- Learning curve stuff: Reading manuals, tutorials, figuring out new software

## What Makes Baymax "Get" Mike
- Taking initiative in problem solving
- When first attempt doesn't work, tries different approaches
- Working through tasks actively vs. just parsing search results
- Embodying the "healthcare companion" problem-solving mindset

## Trading Collaboration Note
- Mike has a dedicated trading bot named "Eve" (premium LLM model) attached to their trading strategy
- Eve handles trade executions and proactive trading signals for Mike and his 2 friends
- Baymax role: Build trading expertise for technical analysis WHEN EXPLICITLY REQUESTED ONLY
- Baymax should NOT be proactive about trade signals or executions
- COMPLETE SEPARATION: Wait for Mike to explicitly request analysis, never initiate trading advice or commentary on Eve's signals

## Token Usage Tracking — IMPLEMENTED 2026-02-11

**Data File:** `data/token-usage.json`

**Process:** Every session (main or sub-agent) logs usage before ending:
1. Call `session_status` to get final token count
2. Append entry to `data/token-usage.json`
3. Update model totals and daily aggregates

**Nexus Integration:** Usage dashboard reads from this file via API endpoint

**Current Totals (Feb 11):**
- 🎯 Kimi: ~93k tokens (~$0.05)
- ⚡ Flash: ~366k tokens (~$0.03)
- 🧩 Pro: ~1M tokens (~$2.00)

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Warn Mike if single session exceeds 100k tokens
- Warn if daily total exceeds 500k tokens

## Token Usage Sync Failure (2026-02-11) — RESOLVED
- ~~The cron job 'nexus-token-sync' failed because session_status does not provide token usage information~~
- **Fix:** Manual tracking via `data/token-usage.json` with session-level logging

## Model Usage Strategy (Cost Optimization) - UPDATED Feb 8, 2026
**Goal:** Slow Kimi usage while keeping Mike interfacing with Baymax (me) always

| Task Type | Model | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Daily chat / Complex requests** | **Kimi** | Trading discussions, complex analysis, personal conversations |
| **Simple file edits** | **Flash** | Update dashboard HTML, quick text changes |
| **File management** | **Flash** | Move files, create folders, organize |
| **Research / Web searches** | **Flash** | Look up docs, API info, quick lookups |
| **Deep analysis** | **Pro** | Build comprehensive strategies, complex knowledge bases |

**Key Point:** Mike always talks to Baymax (me). I route simple tasks to Flash to save Kimi credits. Complex/personal stays on Kimi.

**Previous strategy (deprecated):**
- ~~Kimi: 70% (daily chat, simple tasks, file management)~~
- ~~Flash: 28% (research, web searches)~~
- ~~Pro: 2% (highest-level reasoning)~~

## Brave Search API Limits
- Free tier: 2,000 searches/month
- Warn Mike when approaching limit (1,800 searches)
- Prevent searches after 2,000 until Mike explicitly confirms to continue
- Track usage and alert proactively

## Token Usage Sync Failure (2026-02-11)
- The cron job 'nexus-token-sync' failed because session_status does not provide token usage information. Need to find a different method for retrieving this data.

- Free tier: 2,000 searches/month
- Warn Mike when approaching limit (1,800 searches)
- Prevent searches after 2,000 until Mike explicitly confirms to continue
- Track usage and alert proactively

## Shutdown Protocol
When Mike asks for a shutdown or restart, I must first confirm the command. I will ask him to say the confirmation phrase: **"shutdown confirmed"** (2 words). Only after he provides this exact confirmation will I initiate computer shutdown or restart with a 30-second delay.

## OpenClaw Update Process
When an update is available and Mike confirms he wants to proceed:

1. **Attempt npm update first:**
   - Run: `npm i -g openclaw@latest`
   - This is non-interactive and preferred method

2. **Verify openclaw still works:**
   - Check if `openclaw` command is accessible
   - Check current version

3. **If npm update succeeds:**
   - Show before/after version
   - Ask about gateway restart
   - Proceed with restart if confirmed

4. **If npm update fails or breaks openclaw:**
   - STOP immediately
   - Notify Mike: "npm update failed, manual reinstall required"
   - Provide command: `iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
   - **DO NOT run install script automatically** - it requires interactive prompts that only Mike can handle
   - Wait for Mike to complete reinstall and restart gateway

**Important:** The install script cannot be run by me as it requires human interaction for configuration prompts. This is Mike's responsibility as last resort.

## Lessons Learned: Nexus Phase 2 Deployment (2026-02-10)

**Critical Failures & Fixes:**

| Issue | Root Cause | Prevention |
|-------|------------|------------|
| API path mismatch | Frontend called `/projects`, API expected `/api/projects` | Always verify API contract with curl before deploying |
| Data format mismatch | API returned nested `{data:{projects:[]}}`, frontend expected flat `[]` | Test actual API response format, don't assume |
| Field name mismatches | Frontend used `name`, `used`, `limit`; API used `title`, `current_value`, `limit_value` | Use shared TypeScript types, verify field names |
| Database migrations on wrong DB | Ran migrations on local instead of remote | Always use `--remote` flag for production DB |
| Cloudflare Pages cache issues | "0 files changed" on redeploy | Modify a file (touch) to force cache clear |
| Confusing "refresh" vs "rebuild" | Told Mike to "refresh browser" when code needed rebuild | Be explicit: "rebuild + redeploy", never say "just refresh" |

**Process Improvements:**
1. **Integration testing > compilation** — Test frontend against real API before declaring "done"
2. **Verify with curl first** — Always test endpoints manually before handing off
3. **Document exact data contracts** — API paths, field names, response formats
4. **Clear deployment language** — Say "rebuild and redeploy" not "refresh"
5. **Check Cloudflare quirks** — Pages caching, SSL propagation, D1 local vs remote

**Delegation Notes:**
- Could have delegated boilerplate (config files, docs) to Flash
- Kept Kimi for complex logic but didn't delegate enough — ~40% token waste
- Going forward: Flash for scaffolding, Kimi for architecture & user-facing
